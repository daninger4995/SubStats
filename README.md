# SubStats
A simple script to post the active users and total subscribers of a subreddit to a discord channel.


This script is my first python/praw script and therefore pretty simple. To use this yourself all you need to do is edit the config_example.py file and fill it in with the reddit info and then the discord webhook URL. Rename that file to config.py and it is ready to run. 

This is meant to be run using a scheduler such as cron however often you want this to be posted.
